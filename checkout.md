# Check Out Instructions

Congratulations, you've made it to the end of the course! Before you leave, lets make sure the lab is clean and ready to go for next semester.

- Take apart all lab apparatus except the aeration system
  - Rinse everything with reverse osmosis water before you store it away; beakers can be left to dry on the racks near the sinks
- Put all sensors back into the drawers with cables coiled neatly
- Neatly organize the storage of workstation supplies
- Clean and wipe down benchtops (these should be completely cleared except for the Stirrer and the Peristaltic Pump which TAs will put away)
- Make sure sinks are empty and cleaned
- Make sure side drawers and cabinets are empty
